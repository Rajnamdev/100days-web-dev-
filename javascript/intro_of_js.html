    <h1>Intro to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language that was initially developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. It was
        originally named Mocha, then briefly called LiveScript before settling on JavaScript. The language was designed
        to add interactivity to web pages in Netscape Navigator, one of the earliest web browsers.</p>
    <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a versatile programming language used primarily for creating dynamic and interactive content on
        web pages. It allows developers to add functionality to websites, such as validating forms, creating animations,
        handling user interactions, and fetching data from servers without reloading the page. JavaScript is supported
        by all modern web browsers and has also gained popularity for building server-side applications using platforms
        like Node.js. Its syntax is similar to other programming languages like Java and C, making it relatively easy to
        learn for those familiar with programming concepts.
    </p>
    <h1>How to execute JavaScript?</h1>
    <p> JavaScript can be executed right inside oneâ€™s browser. You can open the JS console and start writing JS there.
        Another way to execute JS is a runtime like Node.js which can be installed and used to run JavaScript code.
        Yet another way to execute JavaScript is by inserting it inside the <script> tag of an HTML document.
    </p>
    <h1> How to add JavaScript to html</h1>
    <p>JavaScript, also known as JS, is one of the scripting (client-side scripting) languages, that is usually used in web development to create modern and interactive web-pages. The term "script" is used to refer to the languages that are not standalone in nature and here it refers to JavaScript which run on the client machine.
       In other words, we can say that the term scripting is used for languages that require the support of another language to get executed. For example, JavaScript programs cannot get executed without the help of HTML or without integrated into HTML code.
       JavaScript is used in several ways in web pages such as generate warning messages, build image galleries, DOM manipulation, form validation, and more.</p>

    <h1>Adding JavaScript to HTML Pages</h1>
    <p>There are following three ways in which users can add JavaScript to HTML pages.

       Embedding code
       Inline code
       External file
       We will see three of them step by step

I. Embedding code:-
To add the JavaScript code into the HTML pages, we can use the <script>.....</script> tag of the HTML that wrap around JavaScript code inside the HTML program. Users can also define JavaScript code in the <body> tag (or we can say body section) or <head> tag because it completely depends on the structure of the web page that the users use.

We can understand this more clearly with the help of an example, how to add JavaScript to html

<!-- Example

<!DOCTYPE html >  
<html>  
<head>  
<title> page title</title>  
<script>  
document.write("Welcome to Javatpoint");  
</script>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>Inthis example we saw how to add JavaScript in the head section </p>  
</body>  
</html> 
</body> -->

    II. Inline code:-
Generally, this method is used when we have to call a function in the HTML event attributes. There are many cases (or events) in which we have to add JavaScript code directly eg., OnMover event, OnClick, etc.

Let's see with the help of an example, how we can add JavaScript directly in the html without using the <script>.... </script> tag.

Let's look at the example.

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html >  
<html>  
<head>  
<title> page title</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>  
<a href="#" onClick="alert('Welcome !');">Click Me</a>  
</p>  
<p> in this example we saw how to use inline JavaScript or directly in an HTML tag. </p>  
</body>  
</html>   -->

    III. External file:-
We can also create a separate file to hold the code of JavaScript with the (.js) extension and later incorporate/include it into our HTML document using the src attribute of the <script> tag. It becomes very helpful if we want to use the same code in multiple HTML documents. It also saves us from the task of writing the same code over and over again and makes it easier to maintain web pages.

In this example, we will see how we can include an external JavaScript file in an HTML document.

Let's understand through a simple example.

// <html>  
// <head>  
// <meta charset="utf-8">  
// <title>Including a External JavaScript File</title>  
// </head>  
// <body>  
// <form>  
// <input type="button" value="Result" onclick="display()"/>  
// </form>  
// <script src="hello.js">  
// </script>  
// </body>  
// </html>  
</p>
</html>
